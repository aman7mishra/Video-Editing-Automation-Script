# Video Editing Automation Script

This script automates the creation of a video by processing a list of clips, adding text captions, and concatenating them into a final output video. It uses the `moviepy` library for video editing tasks.


## Script Overview

The script performs the following tasks:
1. **Setup Configuration:** Define the input clips with their file paths, start and end times, and text captions.
2. **Create Temporary Directory:** For storing intermediate video files.
3. **Process Clips:** For each clip:
   - Read the input file (video or image).
   - If necessary, loop or reverse the video to match the required duration.
   - Add the specified text caption to the video.
   - Save the intermediate video file.
4. **Concatenate Videos:** Combine all intermediate videos into a final output video.
5. **Resize and Render:** Adjust the final video resolution based on the selected quality.
6. **Cleanup:** Remove temporary files.

## Configuration

### Clips Information

Modify the `clips_info` list to include your video or image files, their start and end times, and the text captions. Ensure the file paths are correct relative to the `mediaPath`.

### Media Path

Set the `mediaPath` variable to the directory where your media files are located.

### Video Quality

Adjust the `video_quality` dictionary to select the desired video resolution and bitrate. The available options are `low`, `medium`, and `high`.

## Usage

1. Place your media files (videos and images) in the directory specified by `mediaPath`.
2. Update the `clips_info` list in the script with your media file names, start and end times, and captions.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python3 script.py
```

4. The final output video will be saved as `final_output.mp4` in the current working directory.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `moviepy` library is correctly installed and accessible in your Python environment.
- The script assumes that the media files are either `.mp4`, `.jpg`, or `.png`. If you use other formats, modify the script accordingly.
- Intermediate files are stored in a temporary directory and are removed after processing.
